Roboflow is an end-to-end computer vision platform that helps you
* collaborate with your team on computer vision projects
* collect & organize images
* understand and search unstructured image data
* annotate, and create datasets
* export, train, and deploy computer vision models
* use active learning to improve your dataset over time

The dataset includes 2656 images.
- are annotated in YOLOv8 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 416x416 (Fit (black edges))

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* Random rotation of between -20 and +20 degrees
* Random shear of between -13째 to +13째 horizontally and -13째 to +13째 vertically
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -20 and +20 percent
* Random Gaussian blur of between 0 and 2 pixels
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 8 percent of pixels
